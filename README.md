## 🏦 What is LoanShot?

LoanShot is a Kotlin/Gradle-based project intended to facilitate (or simulate) lending, borrowing, or loan-related operations on-chain or off-chain. Its architecture is modular, allowing expansion to multiple protocols or loan instruments.

> ⚠️ This project may be in early or work-in-progress stages. Adjust production usage accordingly.

## ✨ Features

- Modular loan / lending functionality (abstracted to allow multiple protocols)  
- Configuration-driven design (addresses, endpoints, tokens)  
- Safe execution logic with checks (fallbacks, slippage, etc.)  
- (Optional) Simulation or dry-run modes  
- Logging, metrics, or monitoring (if configured)

## 🧰 Prerequisites

JDK 17 or newer

Gradle (wrapper included)

Access to node / RPC endpoints (e.g. Ethereum, BSC, or other EVM)

(Optional) Private key / wallet for on-chain operations

## 🚀 Setup & Running

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/cflower6/LoanShot.git
cd LoanShot


Build:

./gradlew clean build


Run:

./gradlew run


Or:

java -jar build/libs/<artifact-name>.jar

🛠 Configuration

Place environment variables in a .env file or set them in your environment:

# RPC configuration
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
NETWORK=mainnet

# Wallet / credentials
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...

# Loan parameters
LOAN_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
COLLATERAL_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
MAX_LTV=0.75
INTEREST_RATE=0.05

# Flags / mode
DRY_RUN=true
LOG_LEVEL=INFO


⚠️ Do not commit your secrets. Use environment variable management or secret stores for production.

## 🧾 Usage Examples

Simulate a loan (without executing on-chain):

DRY_RUN=true ./gradlew run


Execute a borrowing transaction (when fully configured):

./gradlew run


Run on testnet (e.g. Goerli / Sepolia):
Set NETWORK=goerli in your .env or environment

## 🧪 Testing

If there are tests under src/test/kotlin, run:

./gradlew test


Add unit and integration tests for safety and correctness, especially around financial calculations.

## 🚁 Deployment

If you use Docker, Railway, or another platform, you might include:

Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml

Deployment manifest (e.g. railway.json)

CI/CD pipeline

Ensure secret variables are injected securely in the deployment environment.

## 📌 Roadmap & TODOs

 Define clear CLI flags and entrypoint

 Add complete tests (unit + integration)

 Add observability (metrics, logs, alerts)

 Support multiple lending protocols

 Improve error handling & fallback logic

 Documentation and examples
